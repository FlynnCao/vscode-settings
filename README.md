# Flynn's VSCode Settings

[settings](./.vscode/settings.json)
[extensions](./.vscode/extensions.json)
## Introduction

### Settings
Although I disabled **prettier** in most of my projects, it's not mandatory in user settings. You can disabled it freely by adding 	`"prettier.enable": false,`. Ironically, all the setting files were formatted by **prettier**.
